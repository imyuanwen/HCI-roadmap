# HCI roadmap

This is the roadmap that helps you to start learning Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). It's inspired by [Roadmap on becoming a UI/UX designer in 2017](https://github.com/togiberlin/ui-ux-designer-roadmap).

I made this roadmap as a summary of what I've learned about HCI in the past few years. A lot of the content comes from the book *[Norman, D. A. (2013). Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded. New York: Basic Books. London: MIT Press (UK edition)](https://jnd.org/the-design-of-everyday-things-revised-and-expanded-edition/)* and the online course *["Human-computer Interaction" by Georgia Tech](http://omscs6750.gatech.edu/).*

The roadmap is made with [Miro](http://www.miro.com).

ðŸš§ This project is still under construction. If you have any suggestions, don't hesitate to talk with me.
