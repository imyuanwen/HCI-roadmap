# HCI roadmap

This is the roadmap that helps you to start learning Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). It's inspired by [Roadmap on becoming a UI/UX designer in 2017](https://github.com/togiberlin/ui-ux-designer-roadmap).

I made this roadmap as a summary of what I've learned about HCI in the past few years. A lot of the content comes from the book *[Norman, D. A. (2013). Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded. New York: Basic Books. London: MIT Press (UK edition)](https://jnd.org/the-design-of-everyday-things-revised-and-expanded-edition/)* and the online course *["Human-computer Interaction" by Georgia Tech](http://omscs6750.gatech.edu/).*

The roadmap is made with [Miro](http://www.miro.com).

ðŸš§ This project is still under construction. If you have any suggestions, don't hesitate to talk with me.

## Descriptions of concepts
### What is Human-Computer Interaction?

> Humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI) researches the design and use of computer technology, focused on the interfaces between people (users) and computers. Researchers in the field of HCI observe the ways in which humans interact with computers and design technologies that let humans interact with computers in novel ways. (From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction))

### What's the difference between HCI and UX design?

HCI is more academic-based and focuses more on research. UX design is more industry-based and focuses more on practice. While HCI focuses more on understanding the interaction between human and computers through research, UX design focuses more on dictating the rules about how to design a great user experience.

### Human's ability

1. Perception and sensation
